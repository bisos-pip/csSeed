* Overview

/bisos.csSeed/ provides general facilities for creation of arget Oriented
Command-Services (tocs) Modules.

In this model Targets are collections of accessible Managed Objects (MOs). Target-Modules
are Python modules which are aware of the Target's set of MOs

bisos.csSeed is a python package that uses the  [[https://github.com/bisos-pip/pycs][PyCS-Framework]].

* The model and terminology  of Modules, Targets and Managed Objects

[[https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/facter.html][The model of terminology of TocsModules]]  is precise and well defined.


Here is a summary of the key concepts and where appropriate their origins:

- System: as defined in ISO-7498 (X.200)   [[file:./py3/panels/bisos.csSeed/model/X.200.pdf
- Managed Object: as defined in X.700  [[file:./py3/panels/bisos.csSeed/model/X.700.pdf]]
- Managed Object Parameter: as defined in X.720  [[file:./py3/panels/bisos.csSeed/model/X.720.pdf]]
- Target: An entity within a system containing one or more Managed Objects.
- Dest: (Destination) A system containing one or more Targets
- Cluster: A named list of Destinations
- Target-Module: A python module capable of processing specific type of targets.
  Modules can be of different types such as those enumerated below.
- BISOS-CS-Module: A Native CS module that is aware of targets.
  CS-Modules accept one and only one destination
- Uploadable-Modules: Modules that can be uploaded into the PyCS targets environment.
  This is accomplished through the bisos.uploadAsCs package.
- --paralel. Based on a the CS Parameter --paralel, the list of Clusters/Dests/Targets can be
  invoked sequentially or in paralel. Absense of --paralel means sequential.

* Part of BISOS --- ByStar Internet Services Operating System

Layered on top of Debian, *BISOS*: (By* Internet Services Operating System) is a
unified and universal framework for developing both internet services and
software-service continuums that use internet services. See [[https://github.com/bxGenesis/start][Bootstrapping
ByStar, BISOS and Blee]] for information about getting started with BISOS.\\
*BISOS* is a foundation for *The Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem* which is
described as a cure for losses of autonomy and privacy in a book titled: [[https://github.com/bxplpc/120033][Nature
of Polyexistentials]]. /bisos.csSeed/ is part of BISOS.

* Target Awareness of Target-Modules

/bisos.csSeed/ provides various facilities to Target-Modules.

By importing  py3/bisos/csSeed/facterModule_csu.py the following
parameters are defined:

--targetsFile

--targetsNu

--destsList

--cluster

--paralel


* Installation

The sources for the bisos.csSeed pip package are maintained at:
https://github.com/bisos-pip/csSeed.

The bisos.csSeed pip package is available at PYPI as
https://pypi.org/project/bisos.csSeed

You can install bisos.csSeed with pip or pipx.

** Installation With pip

If you need access to bisos.csSeed as a python module, you can install it with pip:

#+begin_src bash
pip install bisos.csSeed
#+end_src

** Installation With pipx

If you only need access to bisos.csSeed on command-line, you can install it with pipx:

#+begin_src bash
pipx install bisos.csSeed
#+end_src

** Post Installation Basic Testing

After the installation, run some basic tests:

#+begin_src bash
csSeed.cs
csSeed networking.interfaces.lo.bindings
#+end_src


* Usage

** Local Usage (system command-line)

=csSeed.cs= does the equivalent of csSeed.

#+begin_src bash
bin/csSeed.cs
#+end_src


* Documentation and Blee-Panels

bisos.csSeed is part of ByStar Digital Ecosystem [[http://www.by-star.net]].

This module's primary documentation is in the form of Blee-Panels.
Additional information is also available in: [[http://www.by-star.net/PLPC/180047]]

** bisos.csSeed Blee-Panels

bisos.csSeed Blee-Panles are in ./panels directory.
From within Blee and BISOS these panles are accessible under the
Blee "Panels" menu.

See [[file:./py3/panels/_nodeBase_/fullUsagePanel-en.org]] for a starting point.
